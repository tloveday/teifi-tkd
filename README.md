## Bugs

## Images

## Problems
- After reviewing previous code taught and used in frameworks I came to question several times what I couldn’t get my Club logo to appear - confusion over directories alongside a learning curve prevented this.
- Finding issues getting my logo to appear large enough to be seen yet small enough to not be overpowering. 
- On class pages I positioned a shorter card representing the instructors taking those classes, however would regularly find my third instructor’s card would appear double the size of the coaches above.
